    <p> I am prior Military. After the military I became a Federal Law Enforcement Officer, then moved on to my home town of Eureka Nevada, where I became a Deputy Sheriff. Now I own my own company. I began my journey into AWS because I want to learn more and continue to grow as a person.</p>
    <p>Some of my hobbies include racing motorcycles, training my son how to race motorcycles and keeping up with my TikTok page.</p>
    <p>Part of my business dealings have taken me all over the world and allowed me to meet many interesting people. Some of the more note-worthy people I have been able to meet are Tom Cruise, Brad Garlinghouse, Gary Busey and many others. Two really cool people I have met and became friends with are Coolio (RIP) and Issac Singleton Jr. </p>
    <p>Happy times in my life:</p>
